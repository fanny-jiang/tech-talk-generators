# Tech Talk: How to Write Asynchronous JS with ES6 Generators

In this tech talk, I introduce ES6 Generators and how they can be used to write asynchronous JavaScript. I briefly introduce the Generator function structure and the unique yield and .next() features to pause and resume a function. I also show an example of how Generators can be used in conjunction with JavaScript promises to make writing asynchronous functions cleaner, easier to read, and even look synchronous.
